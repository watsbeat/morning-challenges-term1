# check which version of ruby you have installed (if it isn’t 2.4.1, then please see a teacher)

# from the command line, create a ruby folder inside of your apps folder (if you haven’t already done so)
# create a file inside the ruby folder called ‘strings’ with the ruby extension


# In IRB calculate — 
#     1. How many hours are in a year.
#     2. How many minutes are in a decade?
#     3. How many seconds old are you?

# To open IRB in the command line, type "irb".
#   1. 365 * 24 =  8760
#   2. 8760 * 60 * 10 = 5256000
#   3. 8760 * 60 * 60 * 24 = 756864000 


# What do you think happens when you combine the following floats and integers?
# Is the result a float or an integer?
# Try computing these in irb —
#     1. 3.0 / 2 = 1.5 (float)
#     2. 3 / 2.0 = 1.5 (float)
#     3. 4 ** 2.0 = 16.0 (float)
#     4. 4.1 % 2 = 0.09999999999999964 (modulo)
